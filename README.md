# Cat Meme Generator

## Description

Week 3 â€“ TechNative Digital's Software Development: Tech Finishing School

In the third week, we worked independently to create an interactive web page using JavaScript to handle forms, events, and API interactions. I have used the CATAPI to create a random cat image generator that users can add text to, to create a meme styled image.

## Technologies used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Implementaions for the future

- Form inputs to add top and bottom text to image
- Mobile Responsiveness
- Ability to edit the colour of text added to the image
