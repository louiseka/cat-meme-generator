## What is Cat Meme Generator?
Cat Meme Generator is an interactive web project built during Week 3 of TechNative Digital’s Software Development: Tech Finishing School.

The project was completed independently and focuses on using **JavaScript** to handle forms, events, and API interactions. It uses The Cat API to fetch random cat images, allowing users to add custom text to create meme-style. images.

## Features
- Fetches random cat images using The Cat API
- Allows users to add text overlays to images  
- Interactive form handling and event-driven UI  
- Fun, meme-style image generation  

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript** – Form handling, events, and API interaction  
- **HTML** – Page structure and layout  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  

### JavaScript Concepts Practiced
- Handling form inputs and user events  
- Fetching data from external APIs  
- DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates  

## Future Improvements
- Add separate form inputs for top and bottom text
- Improve mobile responsiveness  
- Allow users to customise text colour
